This file describes how to configure pam_hbac for access control on a
AIX machine.

Only tested on AIX 7.1 TL4.

Prerequisities
==============
Please make sure your AIX client is able to resolve and authenticate
the IPA or AD users. For example, for users coming from an AD trust:
    $ id administrator@win.trust.test
    $ su - administrator@win.trust.test
A good starting point for this configuration is to read:
    https://www.freeipa.org/page/ConfiguringUnixClients

Building from source
====================
The build environment used to build the module was obtained from the AIX Toolbox
for Linux Applications (https://www-03.ibm.com/systems/power/software/aix/linux/toolbox/alpha.html).
It is recommended to use the yum.sh script provided at the top of their webpage,
it will install the RPM package manager and provide the yum utility
(https://ftp.software.ibm.com/aix/freeSoftware/aixtoolbox/ezinstall/ppc/yum.sh) that
will ensure all dependencies are installed.
Please make sure all required dependencies are installed. On AIX 7.1 TL4, this
would be:
    autoconf-2.69-1 automake-1.15-1 gcc-6.3.0-1 gcc-cpp-6.3.0-1 gettext-0.19.7-1 \
    glib2-2.48.0-1 libtool-2.4.6-2 m4-1.4.13-1 openldap-2.4.40-2 pkg-config-0.19-6

This build does not have manpages. In AIX the utility a2x does something other than
converting asciidoc. It must be either removed from the PATH variable or you
need to explicitly add the --disable-man-pages option to the configure
invocation, otherwise the build will fail.
When building for AIX, use the following invocation:
    $ export M4=/usr/linux/bin/m4
    $ autoreconf -if
    $ LDFLAGS="-L/usr/lib" LIBS="-lpthread" ./configure --sysconfdir=/etc/security/ldap \
            --with-pammoddir=/usr/lib/security --disable-man-pages

SSL/TLS
=======
SSL is working, SSL_PATH points to a certificate file.

Configuration
=============
You need to configure the module itself, then include the module in the
PAM stack. Please see the pam_hbac.conf(5) man page for the available
configuration options.

This has only been tested with the sshd service.
When the config file is created, put the following into /etc/pam.conf:
    sshd     account required       pam_hbac.so ignore_unknown_user ignore_authinfo_unavail

Adding the option `ignore_unknown_user` is important on AIX for the same
reason Linux systems normally use `pam_localuser.so` - pam_hbac looks up
accounts using NSS calls and a failure to look up a user would deny access,
because no rules would apply. Additionally, pam_hbac returns PAM_UNKNOWN_USER
for root, which might be impractical if you decide to put the module into
the system-wide configuration.

Similarly, adding the `ignore_authinfo_unavail` option is handy in case
the LDAP server is not reachable. In that case, pam_hbac would return
PAM_IGNORE and proceed with the rest of the stack instead of a hard error.

Before making any changes to the PAM stack, please make sure to have a root
console open until you finish testing of pam_hbac setup, to make sure you
don't lock yourself out of the system!
